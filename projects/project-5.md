Identity V is my favorite game that I ever played. In this game, there are many characters, but we can divide it into two parts. The first part is called regulators and the second part is called survivors. The regulator's job is to catch survivors while survivors must breakout of five puzzles in order to survive the game.

My favorite character in this game is Emily; she is a doctor and has a treatment tool that helps to treat those who are injured. The tips to play this character is work with other people when doing the puzzles because you can treatment other immediately. Every time you treatment a survior, your scorce will be higher since it is main job of doctor.

The second character that I played most is Emma Woods; she is a gardener and has toolboc that can destroy the execution frame in the scene. The tips to play this character is only removing the entire chairs in the shortest possible time.
