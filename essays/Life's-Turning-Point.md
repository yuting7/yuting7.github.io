When we are still an “egg”, we begin to have the ability to learn a language. At that time, we can hear the weak voice and discern whether it is from different people or things. After we were born, we started  connecting the “real” language, it might from parents, relatives, or your pet at home. Wait a minute! You don’t think that the voice of a pet is also a language? I would say that pets also have their own language. But people still can't understand that this doesn't mean that the language doesn't exist. We can know that trained pets can understand human language.

People learn language so that we can communicate with other people. For example, my native language is Chinese, but after learning English, I can communicate with other people who speak Chinese or English. However, these have a standard which helps us clearly understand what other people wants to express. When I study English, I found that there are many rules in English such as present simple tense, present continuous tense, present perfect tense, and present perfect continuous tense…etc. If you use the wrong grammar tense, it may cause others to misunderstand you. This is especially true for those who write computer programming languages, when there is a very tiny difference, it might lead to very huge different results. Now, we know how importance of language standard is.

After using ESLint with Intellij for a week, I really liked this system.  Think it saves me a lot of time to check for my spelling errors. When I see the green checkmark, it makes me know the language I wrote is understandable and works well in the coding standard. Also, I am excited when I see the red exclamation mark, because it means that I can learn from these mistakes and find what are defects in the program and change them in time. I really like to learn from these errors, because this allows me to be more familiar with programming languages.
