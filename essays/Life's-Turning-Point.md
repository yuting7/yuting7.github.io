When we are still an “egg”, we begin to have the ability to learn a language. At that time, we can hear the weak vibration of voices and discern whether it is from different people or things. After we are born, we start connecting to the “real” language; it might be from your parents, relatives, or even your pets at home. Wait a minute! You don’t think that the voice of a pet is also a language? I would say that pets also have their own language. But people still don’t understand that this doesn’t mean that the language between humans and animals don’t exist. This misunderstanding is wrong because we know we can train pets to understand the human language.

People learn language so that they can communicate with other people. For example, my native language is Chinese, but after learning English, I can communicate with other people who speak Chinese or English. However, there is a standard which helps us clearly understand what other people want to express. When I studied English, I found that there were many rules in English such as present simple tense, present continuous tense, present perfect tense, and present perfect continuous tense, etc. If you use the wrong grammar tense, it may cause others to misunderstand you. This is especially true for those who write computer programming languages. Even when there is a very tiny difference, it might lead to very huge different in terms of results. Now, we know how important having language standards are.

After using ESLint with Intellij for a week, I really liked this system.  I think it saves me a lot of time from having to manually check for my own spelling errors. When I see the green checkmark, it lets me know that the language I wrote is understandable and works well in the coding standard. Also, I am excited when I see the red exclamation mark because it means that I can learn from these mistakes and find what are some errors I made within the program and change them in time. I really enjoy learning from these mistakes because this allows me become more familiar with the different programming languages.
