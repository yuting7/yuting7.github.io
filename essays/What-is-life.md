## What is life?

Learning is the most important thing to a human. For example, we need to learn how to speak, how to write, how to analyze stuff. Learning helps people grow up and get a better life. Every day, we are learning new things such as meeting a different person or event, and we can learn from the person’s knowledge or behavior, also we can learn from the event that teaches us or how to solve a problem in the event.

## Software Engineering

I have been learning computer science for two years. When I decided to gain a higher education after high school, I did not know what my major would be and what I should do in the future. At that time, I was super lost of my future, but I met my best friend who told me that “Though looking threatening, all the crises are survived one after another.” and “DO NOT BE AFRAID”. After we discussed my future, she told me that computer science is a good major, but it is also a very challenging major. So, I chose this major and I told myself that do not care about how hard it will be or how much time it takes to graduate, the only thing I should care about is how much I can learn from it.

## In the future

I hope that I can learn more skills such as creating apps and learning more different programming languages. In this semester, I know I will learn JavaScript, I want to learn how to use this language to create an app. I also want to develop my communication skills since I have a hard time to talk with others.
