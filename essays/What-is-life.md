## What is life?

Learning is the most important thing to a human. For example, we need to learn how to speak, how to write, how to analysis stuff. Learning helps people grow up and to get a better life. Every day, we are learning the new things such as we meet the different person or event, and we can learn from the person's knowledge or behavior, also we can learn from the event that teaches us or how to solve a problem in the event.

## Software Engineering

I have been learning computer science for two years. When I decided to go to a higher education after high school, I did not know that what is my major will be and what should I do in the future. At that time, I am super lost of my future, but I met my best friend who tells me that "Though looking threatening, all the crises are survived one after another." and "DO NOT BE AFRAID". After we discuss my future, she tells me that computer science is a good major, but it is also a very challenge major. So, I chose this major and I tell myself that do not care about how hard it will be or how much time it takes to graduate, the only thing I should care is how much I can learn from it.

## In the future

I hope that I can learn more skills such as creating apps and learn more different programming languages. In this semester, I know I will learn the JavaScript, I want to learn how to use this language to creating an app. I also want to develop my communication skill since I have hard time to talk with others.
