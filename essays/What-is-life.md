What is life?
Learning is the most important thing to a human. For example, we need to learn how to speak, how to write, how to analysis stuff. Learning helps people grow up and to get a better life. Every day, we are learning the new things such as we meet the different person or event, and we can learn from the person's knowledge or behavior, also we can learn from the event that teaches us or how to solve a problem in the event.

Software Engineering
I have been learning computer science for two years. When I decided go to a higher education after high school, I did not know that what is my major will be and what should I do in the future. At that time, I am super lost of my future, but I met my best friend who tells me "DO NOT BE AFRAID" and "Though looking threatening, all the crises are survived one after another.". After we discuss about my future, she tells me that computer science is a good major, but it is also a very challenge major.

In the future
