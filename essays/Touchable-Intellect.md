Life is made up of many choices and problems. However, communication between people becomes very important during this time because it helps people understand the problem and solve the problem. When we are stuck on the problems or questions that we may have, and we are trying to find a solution, we should think about how to ask a good question. In my English learning experience, the most important thing when asking a good question is letting other people and yourself understand what the problem is. For example, what is the difference between “I saw the movie” and “I have seen the movie”? I am always confused about when to use simple past tense and present perfect tense, therefore, it makes people misunderstand what my question is. According to Eric Raymond in [“How to ask questions the smart way”](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), he gave details about how to avoid the stupid question and teaches us how to ask questions in a smart way as well.

Now, I want to give some questions on stack overflow to help you understand better on how to produce a good question. Here is the link to a [smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value?rq=1). This questioner asked exactly what his problem is. The good thing about this questioner is that he shows his process of how he tried to find a solution. He also showed his thought process by saying “I don’t think I understand the distinction they’re making.” As a result, the question was resolved in the first answer given on what the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference is and the questioner was able to understand the difference by looking at the example codes. Here is a link to ask a [non-smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32791902/how-can-i-determine-the-birth-month-of-a-pregnant-woman-if-i-know-the-month-she). This questioner might make other people confused about his question. I think “What month did you take in?” is not a smart question in comparison to “What month did you conceive in?”. This is because the phrase “put to birth” is translated as “give birth” which helps others to understand what exactly his question is.

# Conclusion
We are all human beings and we all make mistakes in our lives. I think it is good to know how to ask a question in a smart way. Asking a good question can increase our chances of finding a solution to a suited question.
