Life is made up of many choices and problems. However, communication between people becomes very important at this time, because it helps people understand the problem and solve the problem. When we are stuck in problems or questions and trying to find the solution, we should think about how to ask a good question.  In my English learning experience, the most important thing to ask a good question is letting other people and yourself understand the problem is. For example, what is the different between "I saw the movie" and "I have seen the movie"? I am always confused about the simple past tense and present perfect tense. Therefore, it makes people misunderstand my question is. According to Eric Raymond in [“How to ask questions the smart way”](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), he gave details about how to avoid the stupid question and teach us how to ask questions in a smart way as well.

Now, I want to give some questions on stack overflow to help you understand better on how to produce a good question. Here is the link to [smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value?rq=1). This questioner asked the exactly his problem is. The good thing about this questioner is he shows his process of how he tried to find a solution. He also shows that his thought by saying "I don't think I understand the distinction they're making." From the result, the question was resolved in the first answer given on what is the different between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference and the questioner was able to understand the difference by looking at the example codes. Here is a link to ask a [non-smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32791902/how-can-i-determine-the-birth-month-of-a-pregnant-woman-if-i-know-the-month-she). This questioner might make other people confused about his question. I think "What month did you take in?" is better said as "What month did you conceive in?" and "put to birth" is translated as "give birth" which helps others to understand his exact question is.

# Conclusion
We are human and we all make mistakes in our life. I think it is good to know how to ask a question in a smart way. Asking a good question can increase our chances to find a solution to suited question.
