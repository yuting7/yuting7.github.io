Life is made up of many choices and problems. However, communication between people becomes very important at this time, because it helps people understand the problem and solve the problem. When we are stuck in problems or questions and trying to find the solution, we should think about how to ask a good question.  In my English learning experience, the most important thing to ask a good question is letting other people and yourself understand the problem is. For example, what is the different between "I saw the movie" and "I have seen the movie"? I am always confused about the simple past tense and present perfect tense. However, it makes people misunderstand my question is. According to Eric Raymond in [“How to ask questions the smart way”](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), he gave details about how to avoid stupid question and teach us how to ask quesiton in smart way as well.


Now, I want to give some questions on stack overflow to help you understand better on how to produce a good question. Here is the link to [smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value?rq=1). This questioner asked the exectly his problem is.
Here is a link to ask a [non-smart question]().
