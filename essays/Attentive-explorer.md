If you want to be a competent explorer, you must have absolute patience and be extra careful with everything. The process of learning UI frameworks is like looking for treasures. It is like assembling a "house" of its own unique style. We can choose whatever we want, and everything in this house is like a "treasure".

When we use the Semantic UI it seems to be a “treasure tool”, we can use this tool to plan the look and location of the item. This tool can save a lot of development time, increase the importance of the code, and make development easier. But at the beginning we don't know how to use these tools to help us, but we need to invest a lot of time to familiarize ourselves with the use of this tool. In the process we will have a lot of frustration, like the tools you use can't do what you expected, or it's possible that you used the wrong tool to find the treasure you want. But when we know how to use these tools and use them correctly, it seems that it is not too difficult to form a unique house.

Although we can also use the raw HTML and CSS to help us assemble the "house", this tool is easy to make the interior of the house too messy, and it is not easy to find what you want. When I started learning the Semantic UI, I found that the language was difficult at first, but it helped me to organize the interior of the house clean and comfortable, so using the UI framework is like finding a new skill. Treasure, it helps software engineers save some space and time.
