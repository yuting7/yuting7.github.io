There are so many different "language" in the world, such as Chinese, English, Japanese, etc... in daily conversations, or java, javascript, c, c++, etc.... of the programming language. But these languages all depend on a pattern, which is a pattern that humans can understand. The interpretation of the word “design pattern” is the reusable solution to commonly occurring problems, or it can be thought of as the template that can be used in many different situations. Using design patterns can help us not have to write the same programming repeatedly, which is make life easier.

One of the design patterns is building pattern, which combines small pieces into a big piece. In this semester I have been use javascript to make the web page that contains navbar, body, and footer. In my life, I think the design pattern can be every items, food, even the air. Because they are all combined with small pieces into a big piece.
