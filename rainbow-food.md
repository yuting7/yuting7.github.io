[Rainbow Food](http://rainbowfood.meteorapp.com/#/) App.  

As human beings, we all have a foraging skill. But we will want to use a fast and easier way to find our meals in the era of high technology. 
However, this app will provide the information that you need.

Rainbow Food is an application that allow UH Manoa students to see all the delicious meals across campus. The application also includes 
that students can view the most popular meals of the day by sorting the ratings of likes. Rainbow Food also provides vendors to update 
and manage their meals they have, and they also can describe their food item with image.

There should be 3 people in the group, but there is only one teammate work with me since the other teammate does not communicate with us. But overall, 
this is still an awesome project experience, I had a lot of practice on how to layout the web-page using Semantic UI React, specifically cards and grids.
